                MYSP In Action aims to capture and share best practices happening across the system that directly support the <a href="https://www.tdsb.on.ca/Leadership/Boardroom/Multi-Year-Strategic-Plan">2024-2028 Multi-Year Strategic Plan (MYSP) strategic directions.</a> 
                With Equity as a guiding principle, the MYSP In Action initiative will showcase best practices in instructional strategies and school and student initiatives to recognize excellence 
                in TDSB schools, share ideas and inspire action.  
            </p>

                To start, MSYP in Action will focus on showcasing best practices connected to the strategic direction of Belong, which aims to ensure all students belong, are engaged, and feel valued 
                in an inclusive environment. Check out the best practices below to see how TDSB staff are taking action to foster equity, well-being and connection to create the conditions necessary 
                for student engagement, belonging, and success.
